This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover insights, trends, and patterns that may influence passenger survival. Using Python and popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, we begin by loading and understanding the structure of the dataset. Summary statistics—including mean, median, and standard deviation—are generated to get a high-level view of the data distribution and identify missing values.

Visualizations play a key role in EDA. Histograms and boxplots are used to explore the distribution and outliers in numeric features like age and fare. Correlation matrices and pairplots help in identifying relationships between features, such as the link between passenger class and survival. Categorical analysis, such as survival by gender or class, reveals crucial insights—such as women and first-class passengers having higher survival rates.

Overall, this analysis highlights the importance of feature relationships and helps form hypotheses for predictive modeling. It provides a strong foundation for further machine learning tasks while also showcasing how visual exploration can lead to meaningful interpretations of data. This Titanic EDA serves as a fundamental step in understanding structured data and making informed, data-driven decisions.
